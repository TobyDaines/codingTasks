# Coding Tasks

This is a repository of various coding tasks that I completed during my online Data Science Bootcamp with CoGrammar/HyperionDev.
Each tasks aims to hone in on a new skill and extract meaningful insights hidden in the data.

## titanic.ipynb

This is an exploratory data analysis of the titanic dataset which aims to assess the key factors which affected survival rate on the Titanic.
I have included numerous visualisations and statistics to determine factors which affected survival rate the most as well as those which had little effect.
I have also aimed to answer questions such as whether or not first class passengers were likely given preference of lifeboats, adding to the level of detail of my data analysis.

## Kmeans_task.ipynb

This is a file that delves into the intricacies of the unsupervised machine learning algorithm k-means clustering.
This file shows how to implement a k-means clustering algorithm in Python.
It also depicts an idea of how closely the hidden patterns discovered accurately represent the real data and the factors separating each cluster and how we can label them.

## sentiment_analysis.py

This is a file that explores the power of natural language processing using spacy.
For a given set of customer reviews, how are workers able to gather insights about their product if it means they would have to read through thousands of reviews?
Luckily, this simple programme of sentiment analysis can extract all of those reviews and tell us whether they are positive, negative or neutral just by data cleaning and extracting the key words.

## neural_network_task.ipynb

This file explores the new and fascinating concept of neural networks, a machine learning algorithm that learns by mimicking the behaviour of synapses in our brain.
This is an introductory file that explores how logic gates can be coded in Python.

## Multiple Linear regression.ipynb

This is a file that explores the supervised machine learning algorithm: multiple linear regression. 
This is very useful for comparing different values of multple pieces of linear data including gradient and intercepts.
For this file, we are comparing house prices in different locations.
