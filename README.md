# Coding Tasks

This is a repository of various coding tasks that I completed during my online Data Science Bootcamp with CoGrammar/HyperionDev.
Each tasks aims to hone in on a new skill and extract meaningful insights hidden in the data.

## titanic.ipynb

This is an exploratory data analysis of the titanic dataset which aims to assess the key factors which affected survival rate on the Titanic.
I have included numerous visualisations and statistics to determine factors which affected survival rate the most as well as those which had little effect.
I have also aimed to answer questions such as whether or not first class passengers were likely given preference of lifeboats, adding to the level of detail of my data analysis.

## Kmeans_task.ipynb

This is a file that delves into the intricacies of the unsupervised machine learning algorithm k-means clustering.
This file shows how to implement a k-means clustering algorithm in Python.
It also depicts an idea of how closely the hidden patterns discovered accurately represent the real data and the factors separating each cluster and how we can label them.

## sentiment_analysis.py

This is a file that explores the power of natural language processing using spacy.
For a given set of customer reviews, how are workers able to gather insights about their product if it means they would have to read through thousands of reviews?
Luckily, this simple programme of sentiment analysis can extract all of those reviews and tell us whether they are positive, negative or neutral just by data cleaning and extracting the key words.

## neural_network_task.ipynb

This file explores the new and fascinating concept of neural networks, a machine learning algorithm that learns by mimicking the behaviour of synapses in our brain.
This is an introductory file that explores how logic gates can be coded in Python.

## Multiple Linear regression.ipynb

This is a file that explores the supervised machine learning algorithm: multiple linear regression. 
This is very useful for comparing different values of multple pieces of linear data including gradient and intercepts.
For this file, we are comparing house prices in different locations.

## mnist_task.ipynb

This file explores image processing using the supervised machine learning model: random forests.
It uses the famous mnist dataset containing small images of handwritten numerical digits.
By sorting these images into training and test sets, our algorithm can suggest what number a new handwritten digit is likely to be with a high degree of accuracy.

## decision_tree_titanic.ipynb

This file explores the concept of decision trees using our beloved titanic dataset.
Decision trees are used in many different disciplines but here we are determining how different factors affect survival rate.
Our machine learning model creates a flowchart to assess how closely a proposed set of variables affecting survival rate mirrors the real data.

## simple_and_multiple_linear_regression.ipynb

This file explores simple linear regression and multiple linear regression and identifies the best scenarios to use either one.
These models can be really useful to predict certain values of a given dataset and very clearly identifies trends for linear data.

## Feature Scaling example.ipynb

This file gives us an example of how feature scaling can be used for data analysis.
We are given some data where the scale of one of the variables is far different from the rest of the variables.
We are unable to numerically compare the rest of the values with this one so we need to apply feature scaling.
By doing this, the scales of all of the variables are standardised meaning we can numerically compare them without any trouble.
